COMPILING BROGUE
----------------

You need libtcod-1.5.1 and SDL 1.2 to compile Brogue yourself.

Find the appropriate version of libtcod at:
http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/

Or download directly:
 * for mingw: http://doryen.eptalys.net/?file_id=27
 * for Visual Studio: http://doryen.eptalys.net/?file_id=29

Get SDL from http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php -- you want the
Development Library for Win32; the direct link is
http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.14-mingw32.tar.gz
(and if you can't extract a .tar.gz, do yourself a favor and get 7zip.)


USING THE PROJECT FILE (brogue.cbp)
-----------------------------------

Get the mingw version of libtcod-1.5.1 and the mingw version of SDL.

If you do not have Code::Blocks, go to
 * http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26#windows
and get the version that includes mingw.

You must unzip and put libtcod-1.5.1 and SDL-1.2.14 in "Brogue Source"
(alongside "BrogueCode" and "PlatformCode") for the project to work unchanged.

You MAY use version 1.5.2, but you must rename the folder "libtcod-1.5.1" to
use the project file unchanged, or you may modify the project file.

Happy hacking.
