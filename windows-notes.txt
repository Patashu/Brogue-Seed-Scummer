This document describes functionality specific to the Windows build.

Be sure to read Readme.rtf, too!

Brogue now supports remapped keys.  The remapping engine is quite limited
and is described in the file named 'keymap'.  It has no extension, but it's
just a text file you can open with notepad.

Press F12 or alt-enter to toggle fullscreen mode.

Press -/+ or pgdn/pgup to adjust the font size

--

The following switches are accepted.  To use them, just make a shortcut to
brogue.exe, edit the shortcut's properties, and add them (separated by
spaces) to the Target text field.

-n                         start a new game, skipping the menu
-s seed                    start a new game with the specified numerical seed
-o filename[.broguesave]   open a recording (extension may be omitted)
-v recording[.broguerec]   view a recording (extension may be omitted)
-M                         same as --no-menu

--size N                   starts the game with font size N (1 to 13)
--no-menu                  never display the menu (automatically pick new game)
--scores                   dump scores to standard output and exit immediately
--noteye-hack              ignore SDL-specific application state checks


--SDL	force libtcod mode with an SDL renderer (default)
-gl	force libtcod mode with an OpenGL renderer (faster, when it works)

It should be possible to open a save by dragging it onto Brogue.exe, but that
only seems to work when the save is in the same path as the executable, for now.

To build Brogue for yourself, dive into the "Brogue Source" folder and read how-to-build.txt
